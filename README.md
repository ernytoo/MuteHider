# MuteHider
MuteHider is a mod for Gorilla Tag which allows you to hide and mute annoying Monkes! Keep in mind this can interfere with gameplay so take it out before playing any competitive.

## What the mod does
- Moves the Muted Monkes rigs far away from the map, so that you cannot see them!
- The mod will not function if you are MasterClient (top of the leaderboard) as the tags go through you, and the muted person won't be able to get tagged or tag anyone as it will detect they are too far away.
